Producer, DJ, and multi-instrumentalist, Doug $ (dɪə'neəer-əʊ) took a break from his roots in classical music to build a career in marketing, working with some of the world's top brands, including Warner Bros. and adidas. When he returned to music, he approached it in a completely new way. Moon Wolf was launched as a solo experiment and has evolved from pop/rock into a genre-bent, eclectic, indie-pop/dance sound. $'s lyrics are an extension of his worldview and meant to provoke thought, if not social change through positive action. "I think we have not just an opportunity, but a responsibility, to make the world around us a better place," he says. "I try to stay focused on the moment -- highs and lows -- and do the best I can to respond in a positive manner. The power of our choices can be intoxicating and devastating. That's a huge part of what inspires my music." iOS devices and apps play a central role in Moon Wolf live performances. Motivated by necessity, $ quickly embraced the distinctive nature of this developing technology, which empowers a mix of semi-acoustic, live looping, sequenced arrangements and DJ sets. Furthermore, the live set is scalable and adaptable to each situation, making every performance unique. A cosmic energy source that most often manifests itself in the shape of a wolf, and frequently appears in the heavens, is the inspiration behind the name.
